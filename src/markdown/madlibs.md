## Overview

[üìπ Create a MAD LIBS Game with Python Video Overview](https://www.loom.com/share/7fedd457c88340aa9f32d1facf90e773)


In this project you will get user input to complete and print a Mad Libs Story for your user.

To complete this project, you should have completed the modules: Intro to Python and Repl.it, Variables and Data Types, and User Input 
Or have previous coding experience in these topics.

#### I can‚Ä¶
*   create a program in repl.it
*   create a comment
*   use the print command
*   create variables following naming rules and conventions
*   list and use three data types: strings, ints, and floats
*   receive, store, and print user input
*   use the input method with a prompt
*   print statements that include user input, text, and variables of data types str, int, and float

##  Project Criteria

### Step 1 - Read through the project criteria

*  Read through all the directions for this project before you start

### Step 2 - Fork a repl.it program 
*  Open the link to the mad_libs repl.it in the sources above 
*  Fork the program to create your own copy

### Step 3 - Identify variables needed 
*  Read the story to find the variables you need to create 
*  Create the variables at the top of your program

### Step 4 - Get user input 
*  Use the input method  and prompt to get data from your user 
*  Add an input method with a prompt to receive a value for each variable 

### Step 5 - Store user input 
*  Store your user input in variables 
*  Use the pattern variable = input(‚Äúprompt‚Äù)| 

### Step 6 - Print the story
*  Create print statements around your text to include variables 
*  Make sure to use extra spaces before and after variables when using the + operator to combine strings

### Step 7 - Debug and fix errors
*  Run your program and fix any errors 
*  If you are having trouble finding your error, you can add a # to the beginning of lines one by one to find the line with the bug 
*  The # character creates a comment but can comment out any line of code you don‚Äôt want Python to run

### Step 8 - Add comments
*  Add a comment at the top of your program to explain it 
*  Optional: add additional comments to separate sections of your code

### Bonus - Add a title and directions 
*  Add introductory statements to explain the program to your user before your input statement

### Bonus+ -  Add an ASCII image
*  Use print statements to include an ASCII image that fits your story‚Äôs theme
